## What is Creative Coding

To create a program that is expressive in contrast to functional

## p5.js

### what is p5.js

> p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.

> Using the metaphor of a sketch, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, youâ€™re not limited to your drawing canvas. You can think of your whole browser page as your sketch, including HTML5 objects for text, input, video, webcam, and sound.

### p5.js community

>We are a community of, and in solidarity with, people from every gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, disability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, and background. We acknowledge that not everyone has the time, financial means, or capacity to actively participate, but we recognize and encourage involvement of all kinds. We facilitate and foster access and empowerment. We are all learners.

### how to use p5.js

- the [p5.js website](https://p5js.org/)
- the [p5.js online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)

To have the ability to save sketches you will need to [create an account](https://editor.p5js.org/signup) on the p5.js website

## Basics

### The Online Editor Interface

- the sketch
- the preview
- the console

### Functions

- setup() and the draw()
- console.log()
- circle()

### Variables

- text
- numbers
- expressions

### Global Variables

- width and height
- mouseX and mouseY

## Drawing Some Shapes

- the coordinate system
- basic shapes : circles, lines, rectangles, ellipses
- placing shapes relative to width and height
- placing shapes relative to mouse position
- graphics : the stroke() and fill() functions
- colors : labels and hex codes

- Example 1 : Drawing a circle of radius 10 that follows the mouse position

`circle(mouseX, mouseY, 10);`

- Example 2 : Drawing a circle of radius 10 at the center of the sketch, whose radius varies depending on mouse x-position

`circle(width/2, height/2, 10);`

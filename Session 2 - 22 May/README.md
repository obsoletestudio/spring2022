# 2nd Session

## Chaotic Design, an introduction to randomness in generative art

### The random function

the [random() function documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random) on the p5.js reference

- evaluating the random() function in the console
- using the random() function

## A Practical Scenario : The Random Walker

### A simple Random Walker Algorithm
initialization of the random walker

random walker algorithm

- move randomly on x
- move randomly on y
- draw walker
- start again

### Coding a simple Random Walker

code-example-1.js

## Ideas to make the code better

We need to somehow check if the random walker is going out of the frame and either :
- put them back in the center of the sketch if he goes out of the frame

## Conditions and Statements

- using the if condition
- how many cases do we need to study ?

### In-Class Exercise 1 :

Adding a custom function to reset the random walker's position when it is out of bounds

code-example-2.js

### In-Class Exercise 2 :

Adding a custom function to wrap the random walker's position to opposite walls (Snake 2 Behavior from Nokia 3310 phone)

code-example-3.js


### Variable Scope
